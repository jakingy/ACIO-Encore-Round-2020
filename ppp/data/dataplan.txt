query X strats:
- always query 1
- 1/H chance for each layer for a query
- bias queries to the top
- bias queries to the bottom
- subtask 2 style

query R strats:
- random
- bias low
- bias high
- middle bias
- subtask 1 style

ai and bi strats:
- for subtask 1, create a tree that is wanted, and make everything else random.
- random (done)
- subtask 3 style
- subtask 4 style
- keep track of the tree connecting to 1 and bias queries to it
- perhaps bias to not leave the tree connecting to 1?
- every range overlaps some point (done)
- no range overlaps (done)
- bias high levels to have higher bi and lower levels to have lower ai (done)
- only one line active at a time *partition R on each side of a node* (done)
- get all ranges to contain a points and query at and around the point (done)
- get multiple points and makes sure some ranges contain theses points (done)
- bigger ranges at the top (done)

- min case
- max case
